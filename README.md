# F1 Telemetry Recorder — F1 25

A desktop application for recording **F1 25** UDP telemetry during **Time Trial** sessions and exporting distance-normalized lap data as structured JSON for analysis and comparison.

This tool is designed to help drivers identify where they gain or lose time by comparing their telemetry (speed, throttle, braking, steering, gears, DRS) against reference laps.

## 📂 Exported JSON Format

Each completed lap is exported as a single JSON file:

```json
{
  "time_normalized": {
    "0": 0.00,
    "1": 12.34
  },
  "speed": [
    { "x": 0, "y": 123 },
    { "x": 1, "y": 125 }
  ],
  "brake": [
    { "x": 0, "y": 0.000 }
  ],
  "throttle": [
    { "x": 0, "y": 1.000 }
  ],
  "gear": [
    { "x": 0, "y": 3 }
  ],
  "steer": [
    { "x": 0, "y": -0.123 }
  ],
  "drs": [
    { "x": 0, "y": 1 }
  ],
  "lap_stats": {
    "speed_top": 123,
    "speed_average": 123.4,
